# About

This is source code for GVSU's CIS 163 class as it was taught in... 2011? Maybe? It's probably super out of date but I am keeping it here to reference the different Java examples if I ever choose to jump back into Java.

Also apparently there's some CIS-457 / security stuff in here. These functions have not been audited and do not generate things securely. Please do not use them in any production systems.
